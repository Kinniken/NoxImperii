  <description>A large, light planet of shallow seas and many islands, Harkan is unusual in being home to two sapient species: one land-based, though keen sailors, and one aquatic, though more at home in shallow seas than in oceanic depths.

  Their ancestral if limited conflicts have taken a dangerous new turn with the arrival of the Empire and the Roidhunate on the world; having each chosen to support a client specie, the two realms are now engaged in a low-level proxy conflict that could degenerate at any moment.</description>
 	<bar>The Empire's military base might be small, but it has a small mess. The view over Harkan's oceans is spectacular.</bar>

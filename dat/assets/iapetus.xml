  <description>An uninhabited moon of Saturn, Iapetus is mostly remembered for the ill-fated 21st century scientific expedition that met disaster there.
  
"The spacecraft rotated while orbiting the moon, to maintain a steady optical field. It had crossed the dawn line, presently at the middle of the inward-facing hemisphere. Thus it had left bare, crater-pocked land behind it in the dark, and was passing above sunlit glacier country. Whiteness dazzled, glittered in sparks and shards of color, reached fantastic shapes heavenward; cirques, crevasses, caverns brimmed with blue." ("The Saturn Game")</description>

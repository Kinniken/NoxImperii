  <description>Kashi was settled in the 23rd century by a monastic order of Shaivites monks from the northern parts of former India. Their ambitions to establish a closed community centered on the worship of Shiva was doomed to failure after the discovery of important mineral riches and the resulting colonization boom.
  
Capital of the Antares sector, Kashi is now one of the leading industrial centres in this part of the Empire. Its shipyards are particularly famous.</description>
  <bar>While Hindu influence on Kashi has been much diluted, the airport does include this unusual "bar" which serves neither alcohol nor meat but delicious lassies and tasteful vegetarian curries.</bar>

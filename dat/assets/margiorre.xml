  <description>Margiorre is cooler and drier than Dandalo, almost desertic beyond the coastline of the central ocean. It is native to a fairly unremarkable humanoid race, the Nizares, whose sole claim to fame is to have become the first subjects of the Betelgians.

Today Betelgians and Nizares live in close proximity and general harmony, with many Nizares achieving success in Betelgian trading organisations or the world's limited industries.

<bar>The Doge of Betelgeuse's position is mostly honorific, but his court is famed for its glorious exuberance, a d√©bauche of luxuries to rival Terra. This bar caters to Betelgian nobles passing through and reflects it - decorated in multicolor pelts of exotic faunas and pillars of glittering stones, it looks more like the palace of a minor duke.</bar>

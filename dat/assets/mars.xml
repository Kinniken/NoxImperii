  <description>Mars was colonized in the 21st century, with ambitious terraformation plans. Alas for the planet, the discovery of faster-than-light travel doomed it to irrelevance - why spend time terraforming an unpromising world when the universe is full of Earth-like planets ready for the taking?
  
Today, the planet is mostly used as a training base for the Imperial Navy - close to Earth, but with near-unlimited land available. Soldiers and marines of thousands of worlds and hundred of species train in its arid plains.</description>
  <bar>The "Blue Mars" bar is decorated with 3D simulations of a Mars where the terraformation project was completed. The contrast between the lush images of coastlines and red mountains covered with pines and the harsh, rocky plains outside is stark.</bar>

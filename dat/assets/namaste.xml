    <description>Through a quirk of Imperial history, the tropical world of Namaste was colonised by a mix of French and North Indian settlers. Happily situated halfway from the barbarian rims to the galactic west and the court intrigues of Terra to the east, it is a laid-back place, known for its pungent cheese and spicy food, art-house holovids with spectacular dance numbers and immoderate love of political debates fuelled by endless cups of chai and glasses of rose wine.

Its numerous beaches and coves are popular with tourists throughout the sector; Gulabi's pink light makes nights there particularly romantic.</description>
    <bar>The Avenue Cafe is the meeting spot of travellers coming in and out of the Surya system; it is famous for its mango lassies and bitter coffee.</bar>

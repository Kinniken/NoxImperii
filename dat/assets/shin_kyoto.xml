  <description>Shin Kyoto is on the colder side of the habitable range, with large inhospitable Arctic areas and seasonal sea ice extending almost to the equator. It is still a strikingly beautiful world, famed for its rugged mountain ranges and its craggy coastlines.

 Settled by Japanese intellectuals fleeing purges in the dark days of the early 23nd century, it has established itself as a major technology and education centre despite its low population. Despite the arrival of Imperial bureaucrats and Navy officers following its designation as the capital of Sector Arcturus, it remains a rare Imperial world where knowledge is valued above money.</description>
  <bar>The "Zen Garden" models itself on the lovely traditional bars of the university area, but is far too tacky and commercial to be more than a crude imitation.</bar>

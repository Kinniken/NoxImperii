  <description>The world of Tigray was a minor planet in the Kingdom before the war, known mostly as a base for trade with the Empire. The Ixumite court relocated there early in the war under strong Terran protection; the hastily-built "palace" they settled in is a far cry from Gonder's legendary royal fortresses. Tigray's damp, cold climate only serves to make the exiles more miserable, used as they are to Gonder's desert conditions.</description>
  <bar>The taste of the royal elite for Imperial alcohol has not diminished in exile on Tigray, and the spaceport's bar has a selection of whiskeys unmatched for light-years around.</bar>

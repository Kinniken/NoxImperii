  <description>Rin is a quiet world, far away from the turmoil that plagues most of the galaxy. The inhabitants are friendly, always happy to help a beginning captain get his space legs.</description>
  <bar>If space is just getting a bit too much for you, the spaceport bar on Rin is the place to take a load off. It's a tidy place, and the clientele is well behaved. You will find no unsavoury figures here.</bar>


It's been three months to the day since you were expelled from the Imperial Navy's Officer Academy. An unfortunate incident with the commanding Admiral's daughter even your father's connections could not brush under the carpet.

Speaking of your father, it's clear there is no point visiting home any time soon. No matter, you always felt stifled there - the life of a two-bit aristocrat on a provincial world was never for you.

And dear old dad did agree to pay for your new ship. "Take her as far as you want, the farther the better." stated the note that accompanying the sales deed. She isn't much, but she's yours. Fortunes have been started with less.

Disgraced but free, your hopes of a brilliant military career dashed, you're now going to have to work for a living. Novel experience. And who knows, there might be opportunities for glory on the side. Especially with your connections inside the Navy.
 
You might not have been very assiduous during your political tuitions, but no child of the aristocracy, even minor and provincial, can ignore that behind the propaganda the Empire is no longer what it once was. Corrupt and decadent, the sector's foremost power is in slow decline. On the fringes once prosperous worlds are the prey of barbarians, expansionism has all but stopped, and even the Inner Worlds have lost their dynamism.

Beyond Betelgeuse, the reptilian-looking Ardars are challenging the Empire. Their Roidhunate is still smaller, but young and vigorous. No matter how blind the Imperial Elites are, any fool can see that it's only a question of a few generations before they topple the Empire. Hopefully you'll be dead by then.

The Long Night is coming, but you'll be damned if you don't enjoy the decadence before the fall.

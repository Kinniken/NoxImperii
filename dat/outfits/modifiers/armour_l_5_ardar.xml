  <description>The Roidhunate has worked to compensate its weaknesses in shield technologies by improving armours beyond what has been achieved by Terran engineers; this self-repairing armour is the most striking result. Integrated between layers of alloys and composites, miniature repair bots can gradually repair damaged areas while the ship is still in space.</description>

  <description>The Empire's edge in electronics extends to jammers, and this model is the one fitted on modern Imperial Navy ships. Its jamming capacities are  a vital asset for Terra, whether to carry out offensives undetected deep in enemy territory - or more often these days, to allow endangered ships to "perform a strategic withdrawal".</description>
